You are given two arrays, arr and target. In one step, we can reverse any subarray of arr. We need to determine whether or not it is possible to turn arr into target by performing any number of steps.

class Solution(object):
    def canBeEqual(self, target, arr):
        return True if sorted(target)==sorted(arr) else False
