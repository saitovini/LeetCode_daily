You are given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays from the array and then sorted them in non-decreasing order, 
creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2 numbers.Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in the new array.
Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 109 + 7.



class Solution(object):
    def rangeSum(self, nums, n, left, right):
        sumsub = 0
        l =[]
        for i in range(0,n):
            for j in range(i,n):
                sumsub+=nums[j]
                l.append(sumsub)
            sumsub = 0
        return sum(sorted(l)[left-1:right])%(10**9+7)
